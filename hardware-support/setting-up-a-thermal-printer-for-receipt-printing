Thermal ESC/POS printers:
Setting an ESC/POS thermal printer involves 3 steps:

Adding a Printer
Configuring business location to use the added printer.
Installation Pos Print server.
Step1: Adding a Printer
Add a new printer from Settings -> Receipt Printer
Select the appropriate Connection Type:
For “Network” provide the IP Address of the printer.
For “Windows” map the printer to a file and provide the path of the file. You can do this by sharing the printer with your localhost.
The path will be in this format:smb://localhost/my_printer_nameORsmb://computer_name/my_printer_name (where my_printer_name is name of the printer)
For “Linux” your printer device file will be somewhere like /dev/lp
smb://localhost/my_printer_name OR smb://computer_name/my_printer_name (where my_printer_name is name of the printer)(parallel), /dev/usb/lp1(USB), /dev/ttyUSB smb://localhost/my_printer_name OR smb://computer_name/my_printer_name (where my_printer_name is name of the printer)(USB-Serial), /dev/ttyS smb://localhost/my_printer_name OR smb://computer_name/my_printer_name (where my_printer_name is name of the printer)(serial)
Select the capability profile and add character per line supported in the printer.
Save the Printer configuration.
Check the video below for more details on setting it.
Step2: Configuring Business Location to use printer:
Go to Settings -> Business Settings.
For a particular business location, go to “Settings” in actions column.
Change “Receipt Printer Type” to “Use Configured Receipt Printer“
Select the “Receipt Printers” from the list of Receipt Printers
Click on Update.
Step3: Installing POS Print Server
For printing via receipt printer, you will need to install a “pos print server” on your local computer from which UltimatePOS is used.

Download the server from this link: https://bitbucket.org/twf_nikhila/pos_print_server/downloads/?tab=downloads. by clicking on “Download Repository”
Unzip the zip file.
Rename the unzipped folder to “pos_print_server”.
Move the pos_print_server to document root (which is htdocs in XAMPP).
Open Command Prompt or also called terminal. And go to the “pos_print_server” directory. You can go to this directory using “CD” command in the command prompt.
From the Command Prompt which is now inside pos_print_server directory run the below command:
php server.php
After running the command it will start the print server and show a message “Server started…”
Now we are ready to go. Try creating a test sell from the pos screen and it should print in your thermal printer. If you haven’t added a printer then follow the steps mentioned in “Step1: Adding a Printer” and it should work.
Great, now we’re ready to print on a thermal printer.

Give it a test drive.

Devices like mobile phones and tablets can’t be used for printing if a thermal ESC/POS  printer is used.

Video Guide:
Follow the steps as mentioned in this video up to 2.
